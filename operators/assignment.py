""""Assignment operator is "="
#It is used to assign values on the right to the variable on the left.

Example:
      total = 100
      the assignment operator "=" takes the value 100 and store the value on the left 
      which is the address to a storage location termed as " variable" total

 Compound assignment operators
 This is a combination of assignment operator and arithmetic operator.
 a) += addition equal to
 b)-= subtraction equal to   
 c) *= multiplication equal to
 d)/= division equal to
 e)**= exponent equal to
 f)//= floor division equal to
 g)%= modulus equal to

Example:

      k = 7
      k += 2 this is like saying
      k = k + 2 
      the new value stored in "k" will be - 9


      
"""

#-= subtraction
# Example 2:
p = 12
p -= 4

print(f"the value of p is {p}")

#Example:
#*= multiplication

L = 14

L *= 3
print(f"The value of L is {L}")

#/= division equal to  
# Example:
V = 10
V /= 2

print(f"The value of V is {V}")

#**= exponent equal to
# Example:
B = 12
B **= 10
print(f"The value of B is {B}")

#//= floor division equal to
#Example:
H = 12
H //= 3
print(f"The value of H is {H}")


#%= modulus equal to
#Example
Kr = 69
Kr %= 4
print(f"The value of Kr is {Kr}")
